= Fetching =

== Creating the request ==

The request for obtaining app data is:

{{{
$request = $osapi->appdata->get($params);
}}}

The `$params` parameter is an associative array of values you can use to customize the request.  

|| *Key* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| `userId` || `string` || ID of the user to operate on.  You may set this to *"@me"* to fetch data for the current user ||
|| `groupId` || `string` || The name of the group of people to fetch App Data for.  You may set this to *"@self"* to only fetch data for the user corresponding to `userId`, or *"@friends"* to fetch data for the user's friends. ||
|| `appId` || `string` || The ID of the application to fetch App Data for. You may use *"@app"* to fetch data for the current application. ||
|| `fields` || `array` || An array of App Data keys to fetch. || 

Additional parameters you can use are listed in the [http://www.opensocial.org/Technical-Resources/opensocial-spec-v09/REST-API.html#standardQueryParameters OpenSocial specification].

== Response ==

The response for a successful request is an associative array where the keys are IDs corresponding to !OpenSocial user IDs, and the values are associative arrays of App Data key/value pairs:

{{{
Array
(
    [<user id>] => Array
        (
            [<key 1>] => <value 1>
            [<key 2>] => <value 2>
        )

)
}}}

= Creating / Updating =

== Creating the requests ==

The request for creating app data is:

{{{
$request = $osapi->appdata->create($params);
}}}

The request for updating app data is:

{{{
$request = $osapi->appdata->update($params);
}}}

The `$params` parameter is an associative array of values you can use to customize either of these requests.  

|| *Key* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| `userId` || `string` || ID of the user to operate on.  You may set this to *"@me"* to set data for the current user ||
|| `groupId` || `string` ||  You may set this to *"@self"* to update data for the user corresponding to `userId`.  Most containers will not support setting App Data for anything other than @self. ||
|| `appId` || `string` || The ID of the application to set App Data for. You may use *"@app"* to set data for the current application. ||
|| `data` || `array` || An array of App Data key/value pairs to set.  || 

For example, to set values for `key1`, `key2`, and `key3` for the current user, you would set `$params` to:

{{{
  $params = array(
      'userId' => '@me', 
      'groupId' => '@self', 
      'appId' => '@app',
      'data' => array(
          'key1' => 'value 1', 
          'key2' => 'value 2', 
          'key3' => 'value 3'
      )
  );
}}}

== Response ==

Creating or updating App Data has succeeded if the response is not an instance of `osapiError`.
