= Fetching =

== Creating the request ==

The request for obtaining app data is:

{{{
$request = $osapi->activities->get($params);
}}}

The `$params` parameter is an associative array of values you can use to customize the request.  

|| *Key* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| `userId` || `string` || ID of the user to operate on.  You may set this to *"@me"* to fetch activities for the current user ||
|| `groupId` || `string` || The name of the group of people to fetch activities for.  You may set this to *"@self"* to only fetch activities for the user corresponding to `userId`, or *"@friends"* to fetch activities for the user's friends. ||
|| `count` || `number` || Maximum number of results to return. || 

Additional parameters you can use are listed in the [http://www.opensocial.org/Technical-Resources/opensocial-spec-v09/REST-API.html#standardQueryParameters OpenSocial specification].

== Response ==

[http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/trunk/src/osapi/model/osapiCollection.php osapiCollection] of [http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/trunk/src/osapi/model/osapiActivity.php osapiActivity] objects.

= Creating =

== Creating the request ==

The request for creating a new activity is:

{{{
$request = $osapi->activities->create($params);
}}}


The `$params` parameter is an associative array of values you can use to customize either of these requests.  

|| *Key* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| `userId` || `string` || ID of the user to operate on.  You may set this to *"@me"* to set an activity for the current user ||
|| `groupId` || `string` ||  You may set this to *"@self"* to post an activity for the user corresponding to `userId`.  Most containers will not support creating activities for anything other than @self. ||
|| `activity` || `osapiActivity` || An `osapiActivity` object representing the activity to post.  || 

The simplest way to create an [http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/trunk/src/osapi/model/osapiActivity.php osapiActivity] object is to create a new object and set the title and body:

{{{
$activity = new osapiActivity();
$activity->setTitle('Activity title');
$activity->setBody('Activity body');
}}}

Then, to build the request:

{{{
$params = array(
  'userId' => '@me',
  'groupId' => '@self',
  'activity' => $activity,
);
$request = $osapi->activities->create($params);
}}}

== Response ==

Posting an activity has succeeded if the response is not an instance of `osapiError`.
