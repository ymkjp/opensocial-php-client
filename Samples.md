To run the samples, simply unzip the client library distribution to a web accessible directory on a server that supports PHP.

View the source of each sample in the
[/src/examples](http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src/examples/) directory:

  * Fetch a user and their friends, displaying profile information: ([listFriends.php](http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/trunk/src/examples/listFriends.php))
  * Read and write appData: ([appData.php](http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/trunk/src/examples/appData.php))
  * Read and write activities: ([activities.php](http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/trunk/src/examples/activities.php))
  * Send messages: ([messages.php](http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/trunk/src/examples/messages.php))

Additionally, check out the unit tests in the [/test](http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/#svn/trunk/test) directory for more examples of how to use the library.
