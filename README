Welcome to the OpenSocial Platform and REST client libraries!

You may want to first get our sample application up and running so you can see 
exactly how the library is meant to be used, but you can just as well start 
building your own application by grabbing the libraries in the client/ directory.

We've created an application called social-nuts that utilizes a lot of Platform
functionality while remaining fairly simple.  

To get social-nuts running on your own server, you'll want to first open up the
"social-nuts/config.php" file and modify it with your mysql database
configuration.  Also, create the necessary table in your database as described
in the same file.
